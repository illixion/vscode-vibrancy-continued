# ‚ùóÔ∏è Important notice for Windows 10/11 users

### tl;dr YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO RESIZE THE VSCODE WINDOW unless you do this

By default, when Vibrancy is installed on VSCode 1.86 and newer on Windows, your VSCode windows **may stop being resizable, snappable or maximizable**. This is a known issue related to VSCode 1.86 and Electron 27 and it occurs due to hardware acceleration leading to distorted text. Vibrancy will by default apply a mitigation that enables frameless windows, but this also causes issues with window interaction.

The correct process to install Vibrancy on Windows is:

1. Update your VSCode shortcut to include `--disable-gpu-compositing` at the end of "Target" field, for example: `"C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Programs\Microsoft VS Code\Code.exe" --disable-gpu-compositing`
2. (optional) Update your shell configuration to add the same argument to `code`, needed if VSCode isn't running when you use `code`
3. Install Vibrancy Continued
4. Go to settings and check **Disable frameless window** (`vscode_vibrancy.disableFramelessWindow`)
5. Press F1 and select **Reload Vibrancy**

For more information, see issues [#140](https://github.com/illixion/vscode-vibrancy-continued/issues/140) and [#122](https://github.com/illixion/vscode-vibrancy-continued/issues/122).

# ‚ö†Ô∏è "Your VSCode installation appears to be corrupt"

This extension works by editing VS Code's checksum-verified HTML files, which means that a warning prompt will appear after installing and enabling Vibrancy Continued. This warning is safe to disregard, and all changes can be reverted. Click on the cogwheel and select **Don't Show Again** to hide it.

To fix the "[Unsupported]" warning on VS Code's title bar, please refer to this extension: [Fix VSCode Checksums](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lehni.vscode-fix-checksums).

# Supported Operating Systems

‚úî macOS (Intel & Apple Silicon)

‚úî Windows 10/11 (x64 & ARM64)

# Supported code editors

‚úî Visual Studio Code

# Getting Started

1. Make sure the VSCode theme you've selected is 'Dark+' or one of the [supported themes](#vscode_vibrancytheme)

![step-1](./images/step-1.png)

2. Install the extension from [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=illixion.vscode-vibrancy-continued).

3. Press F1 and activate command "Reload Vibrancy."

![step-3](./images/step-3.png)

4. Restart VSCode when prompted.

Each time VS Code is updated, please re-enable Vibrancy using the same steps. If you're experiencing issues, please check the [FAQs](#faqs).

## Options

#### Type (`vscode_vibrancy.type`)

Native method of Vibrancy Effect.

* auto : Automatically switch with system version.
* acrylic : (Windows 10 only) Fluent Design blur.
* under-window, fullscreen-ui, appearance-based, light, dark, titlebar, selection, menu, popover, sidebar, medium-light, ultra-dark: (MacOS only)

#### Opacity (`vscode_vibrancy.opacity`)

Opacity of Vibrancy Effect. -1 is theme default, 0 is maximum transparency, and 1 will remove all transparency.

*value: -1.0 ~ 1.0*

#### Custom imports (`vscode_vibrancy.imports`)

Import any custom CSS/JS files into the VSCode editor, as file paths. The files will be imported in the order they are listed. On Windows, forward slashes must be used.

Use this feature to add a custom Vibrancy Continued theme or modify an existing one.

EXAMPLES:

- Windows: `C:/Users/MyUserName/Documents/custom.css`
- macOS: `/Users/MyUserName/Documents/custom.css`

*value: array[]*

#### Prevent Flash (`vscode_vibrancy.preventFlash`)

Use a new method for preventing window flashing during resizing. Eliminates the need for a refresh interval, but may be less compatible in some cases.

*boolean, default is true*

#### Disable Frameless Window (`vscode_vibrancy.disableFramelessWindow`)

Disable frameless window, which is a mitigation that fixes a GPU-related render bug on Windows with VSCode 1.86 and newer. You may see distorted and blurry graphics if you disable this mitigation with an affected GPU. Running VSCode with a `--disable-gpu-compositing` argument, such as via a shortcut, will allow for this mitigation to be safely disabled.

#### Disable Theme Fixes (`vscode_vibrancy.disableThemeFixes`)

Disable fixes to Default Dark and Default Light themes for non-VSCode editors like Cursor.

#### Refresh interval (`vscode_vibrancy.refreshInterval`)

Refresh interval (in milliseconds) for making the background transparent after window resizing. Lower values make the update less visible at the cost of increased CPU utilization. **Ignored when using "Prevent Flash" method.**

*value: 1 ~ 1000, default is 10*

#### Automatic theme switching (`vscode_vibrancy.enableAutoTheme`)

Enable automatic dark/light mode switching based on OS mode. Requires `window.autoDetectColorScheme` VSCode setting to also be enabled.

*boolean, default is false*

#### Preferred dark/light theme (`vscode_vibrancy.preferedDarkTheme / vscode_vibrancy.preferedLightTheme`)

Select which themes to use for light and dark modes, they will be used instead of the main Vibrancy Continued theme selected.

#### theme (`vscode_vibrancy.theme`)

Select Vibrancy theme:

* Default Dark
* Dark (Only Subbar)
* Default Light
* Light (Only Subbar)
* Noir et blanc
* Tokyo Night Storm
* Tokyo Night Storm (Outer)
* Catppuccin Mocha
* Solarized Dark+
* GitHub Dark Default

# FAQs

### How to uninstall Vibrancy?

Press F1 or ‚åò+Shift+P and activate command **"Disable Vibrancy"**, then restart Visual Studio Code.

You can also just uninstall the extension and restart VSCode, which will automatically remove Vibrancy.

### Nothing happens first time Reload/Enable Vibrancy is used?

There is a known issue with Vibrancy sometimes not working on the first try after VSCode updates, perform the same action again to resolve.

### Effect doesn't work correctly in VSCode terminal?

Check your settings. You should change the renderer type of the terminal to `dom`.

`"terminal.integrated.gpuAcceleration": "off"`

### Prompt "Run Visual Studio Code with administrator privileges"?

It usually appears on Windows when you are using the VSCode System Installer. You should close VSCode completely, then run VSCode as administrator and retry what you did before (Enable/Reload/Disable Vibrancy).

### `EACCES: permission denied` when enabling Vibrancy on macOS?

Your installation of VSCode is owned by another user.

Run the following commands exactly as-is in the Terminal app to take ownership of the files, and enter your password when prompted:
```shell
sudo chown -R $(whoami):staff "/Applications/Visual Studio Code.app/"
sudo chmod -R 755 "/Applications/Visual Studio Code.app/"
```

A reinstallation will also fix this issue without any loss of settings.

### `EROFS: read-only file system` when enabling Vibrancy on macOS?

Your installation of VSCode is affected by [App Translocation](https://eclecticlight.co/2023/05/09/what-causes-app-translocation/).

To fix this, either use the Finder and move VSCode to `/Applications` (or move it out of `/Applications` and then back in), or run the following terminal command:

```shell
sudo xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Visual Studio Code.app"
```

### I'm on Windows 10 and I'm experiencing lag when dragging the window

[Please read here for details](https://github.com/EYHN/vscode-vibrancy/discussions/80).

### VSCode window cannot be resized/moved/maximized after enabling Vibrancy

Please see [Important notice for Windows users](#Ô∏è-important-notice-for-windows-1011-users) at the top of the description.

### Effect doesn't work, but there are no errors

Ensure that you don't have transparency effects disabled globally through your OS settings.

This can usually be found under Accessibility settings, and it may be called "Transparency effects" or "Reduce transparency." If that didn't help, you can also check the Console section in VSCode's Developer Tools, which can be accessed through the command palette.

If nothing else worked, try reinstalling VSCode, you won't lose any settings and this will ensure that your VSCode installation is consistent.

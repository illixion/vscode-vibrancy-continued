This warning is safe to disregard, and all changes can be reverted. Click on the cogwheel and select **Don't Show Again** to hide it.

Press F1 or ⌘+Shift+P and activate command "Disable Vibrancy", then restart Visual Studio Code.

### Effect doesn't work for terminal?

Check your settings. You should change the renderer type of the terminal to dom.

`"terminal.integrated.gpuAcceleration": "off"`

### Prompt "Run Visual Studio Code with administrator privileges"?

It usually appears on windows when you are using the VSCode System Installer. You should close VSCode completely, then run VSCode as administrator and retry what you did before (Enable/Reload/Disable Vibrancy).

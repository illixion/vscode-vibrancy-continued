# ❗️ Important notice for Windows 10/11 users

### tl;dr YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO RESIZE THE VSCODE WINDOW unless you downgrade VSCode to 1.85.2

VSCode 1.86 and newer has known issues on Windows 10/11 due to breaking changes in Electron 27. Your VSCode windows **may stop being resizable, snappable or maximizable** if Vibrancy is applied on Windows, and you must also use "custom" for `window.titleBarStyle` setting. Some users have reported that [AltSnap](https://github.com/RamonUnch/AltSnap) may be able to solve this issue.

If this is undesired, **please downgrade to VSCode 1.85.2**, which can be downloaded using this URL: https://update.code.visualstudio.com/1.85.2/win32-x64-user/stable

For more information, see issues [#140](https://github.com/illixion/vscode-vibrancy-continued/issues/140) and [#122](https://github.com/illixion/vscode-vibrancy-continued/issues/122).

# ⚠️ "Your VSCode installation appears to be corrupt"

This extension works by editing VS Code's checksum-verified HTML files, which means that a warning prompt will appear after installing and enabling Vibrancy Continued. This warning is safe to disregard, and all changes can be reverted. Click on the cogwheel and select **Don't Show Again** to hide it.

# FAQs

### How to uninstall Vibrancy?

Press F1 or ⌘+Shift+P and activate command **"Disable Vibrancy"**, then restart Visual Studio Code.

Just removing the extension without performing this step doesn't run the necessary cleanup code.

### Effect doesn't work for terminal?

Check your settings. You should change the renderer type of the terminal to `dom`.

`"terminal.integrated.gpuAcceleration": "off"`

### Prompt "Run Visual Studio Code with administrator privileges"?

It usually appears on Windows when you are using the VSCode System Installer. You should close VSCode completely, then run VSCode as administrator and retry what you did before (Enable/Reload/Disable Vibrancy).

### `EROFS: read-only file system` when enabling Vibrancy on macOS

Your installation of VSCode is affected by App Translocation. To fix this, either use the Finder and move VSCode to `/Applications` (or move it out of `/Applications` and then back in), or run the following terminal command:

```shell
sudo xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Visual Studio Code.app"
```

### I'm on Windows 10 and I'm experiencing lag when dragging the window

[Please read here for details](https://github.com/EYHN/vscode-vibrancy/discussions/80).

### VSCode window cannot be resized/moved/maximized after enabling Vibrancy

Please see [Important notice for Windows users](#️-important-notice-for-windows-1011-users) at the top of the description.

### Effect doesn't work, but there are no errors

Ensure that you don't have transparency effects disabled globally through your OS settings. This can usually be found under Accessibility settings, and it may be called "Transparency effects" or "Reduce transparency." If that didn't help, you can also check the Console section in VSCode's Developer Tools, which can be accessed through the command palette.

If nothing else worked, try reinstalling VSCode, you won't lose any settings and this will ensure that your VSCode installation is consistent.
